## Change Form Shape \(very easy and comfortable\)


</div>

### Description

Make your form shape like the items placed on it.I saw a code posted a view days ago, this code made the form shape like SHAPE-Controls painted on it. But this OCX not even recognizes Shapes. It also recognizes Buttons, Check-Boxes,..... if you want it to do.
 
### More Info
 
Register Psycho.OCX and but a the OCX on a form. Paint some Shapes or Buttons, Checkboxes, what ever you wnat, and call it how you want it to behave:

Psycho1.MakeRGNShapes  - Cut off ALL SHAPE elemets from Form

Psycho1.MakeRGNAllVisible - Cut off ALL VISIBLE elements from form

Psycho1.MakeRGNALL  - Cut off ALL elements from form
